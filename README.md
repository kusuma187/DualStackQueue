# DualStackQueue
This repository provides an implementation of a queue using two stacks, effectively transforming the Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks into the First In, First Out (FIFO) functionality of a queue. This is a fundamental data structure problem that showcases how stacks can be leveraged to simulate a queue.
# Project Title

**DualStackQueue**

## Description

This project is a data science case study implementation of a queue using two stacks, effectively transforming the Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks into the First In, First Out (FIFO) functionality of a queue.  It involves data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling to extract insights and drive decision-making. The project follows standard data science methodologies, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.
