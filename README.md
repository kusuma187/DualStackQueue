# DualStackQueue
This repository provides an implementation of a queue using two stacks, effectively transforming the Last In, First Out (LIFO) behavior of stacks into the First In, First Out (FIFO) functionality of a queue. This is a fundamental data structure problem that showcases how stacks can be leveraged to simulate a queue.
